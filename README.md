# WDI Project 3: Barista Goals App

## DESCRIPTION
For my fourth WDI Project, I created a full-stack app using React and Ruby on Rails to provide baristas an educational tool to assist in their journey to becoming professional baristas. The goal of the app, is to be a central place for keeping field notes with the added element of expanding to become a social app with baristas all over the world.

## INSPIRATION
The field for Specialty Coffee baristas has grown exponentially since the late 2000's. The profession is recognized on a global level and passionate baristas are always working to improve their craft and their knowledge in the industry. As a former coffee business owner, I always believed in the power of sharing knowledge and creating a culture for our staff that gave them pride in their craft. It also helps to build a coffee community for a city.

## SCREENSHOTS
I wanted to design my app as mobile-first, because I imagined this app being used mostly on mobile devices and/or tablets.

Here are screenshots of my mobile-first design, which turned out to be pretty close to my sketched wireframes.<br/>
